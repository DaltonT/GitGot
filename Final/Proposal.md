1) My final project will be to produce a carousel.
This will include a rotating base, mounted posts, and seats with interpolated vertical movement.

2) Week 1: Rotating base
Week 2: Rotating base in perspective
Week 3: Mounted posts
Week 4: Moving seats
Week 5 (stretch): Extra details- main column, roof, etc.

3) I will create a web-based application, likely using libraries from three.js
such as the shapes and extrude for fine details (such as the seats)
